1. ABSTRACT
This project implements a menu-driven Student Record Management System using the C programming language. 
The program allows the user to add, view, search, and delete student records stored persistently in a file.
It demonstrates the use of structures, file handling, and modular programming techniques to build a scalable 
and maintainable software system.

------------------------------------------------------------
2. OBJECTIVE
The objective of this project is to apply fundamental and intermediate concepts of the C language to 
design a working application. It aims to test the students’ ability to:
- Use structures to represent complex data.
- Employ functions and modular design for code organization.
- Perform file operations for persistent data storage.
- Manage dynamic memory safely and effectively.

------------------------------------------------------------
3. PROBLEM DEFINITION
Many small institutions and training centers require simple tools to maintain student records. 
Manually handling these records is error-prone and inefficient. 
This project provides a basic command-line system for managing student information 
such as Roll Number, Name, and Marks in a text file.

------------------------------------------------------------
4. SYSTEM DESIGN AND ALGORITHM
The system is modular, consisting of multiple source files:
- `main.c` controls program flow and user interaction.
- `student.c` handles CRUD (Create, Read, Update/Delete) operations.
- `utils.c` provides helper functions (like clearing the screen).

Algorithm (Add Student Example):
1. Read student details from user.
2. Open file in append mode.
3. Write the structure to file using `fwrite()`.
4. Close the file.

Each module uses header files for function prototypes and structure definitions.

------------------------------------------------------------
5. IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
Key Language Features Used:
- **Structures** to represent student entities.
- **File Handling** functions (`fopen`, `fwrite`, `fread`, `fclose`) to store and retrieve data.
- **Dynamic Memory Allocation** for flexible record manipulation.
- **Functions** for modularity and clarity.

Example code snippet (writing to file):

```c
FILE *fp = fopen("records.txt", "ab");
if (fp) {
    fwrite(&student, sizeof(Student), 1, fp);
    fclose(fp);
}
